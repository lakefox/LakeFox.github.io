        We've created a cutting-edge technology that allows the operator use simultaneously track up to 500 targets undetected with our SENTEX system. Track data includes 10 digit MGRS grids along with elevation, speed, and direction of travel. The system can be deployed anywhere in the US allowing immediate situational awareness over a target area allowing you to take control of the mission. <br><br> SENTEX weights just under 9 lbs and has a flight time of 7 hours and becomes undetectable at 3,000 ft HAT with the maximum altitude just under 7,000 ft HAT. With a built-in LTE connection, you can control SENTEX anywhere and with anything that has an internet connection with our mission control software.
